🥇 TIER 1 — TRUE PROFIT ENGINE (MOST IMPORTANT NEXT)

Right now your profit_by_product:

❌ Does NOT include:

Marketing cost

Promotions cost

Channel-wise margins

Region-wise margins

✅ Add These (HIGH PRIORITY)
1️⃣ Profit by Channel
def true_profit_by_channel(sales_df, unit_df, marketing_df):


Lets your agent say:

“Instagram is profitable, Google is burning cash.”

2️⃣ Profit by Region
def true_profit_by_region(sales_df, unit_df):


Lets your agent say:

“Delhi looks big in revenue but is actually low-margin.”

3️⃣ Contribution Margin per Order
def contribution_margin_per_unit(sales_df, unit_df):


This is what investors actually care about.

4️⃣ Fake Growth Detector
def fake_growth_products(sales_df, unit_df):


Returns SKUs with:

High revenue

Negative profit

🥈 TIER 2 — DEMAND & FORECASTING (OPS INTELLIGENCE)

Right now your agent is backward-looking only. You want forward-looking power.

✅ Add These
5️⃣ Units Sold Trend
def units_sold_by_month(sales_df):


So it can say:

“Banana Oats demand is declining 3 months straight.”

6️⃣ Rolling 3-Month Demand Forecast
def forecast_next_month_units(sales_df):


So later:

“Produce 18,500 Vanilla next month.”

7️⃣ Inventory Coverage (Days of Stock Left)
def days_of_inventory_left(inventory_df, sales_df):


So it can say:

“You’ll stock out of Choco Coffee in 11 days.”

🥉 TIER 3 — CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE INTELLIGENCE (GROWTH LEVERS)

Right now you only see:

Churn rate

Avg LTV

But you don’t see:

Who churns

When churn happens

What drives churn

✅ Add These
8️⃣ Churn by Segment
def churn_by_segment(customers_df, segments_df):


So it can say:

“Students are churning twice as fast as professionals.”

9️⃣ LTV by Region
def ltv_by_region(customers_df, sales_df):


So it can say:

“Bangalore customers are 2× more valuable.”

🔟 Repeat vs One-Time Buyers
def repeat_purchase_rate(customers_df):

🏆 TIER 4 — EXECUTIVE / INVESTOR METRICS (OPTIONAL LATER)

These turn your agent into a boardroom assistant.

✅ Advanced but Insane Value
11️⃣ Monthly Burn Rate
def monthly_burn(marketing_df, unit_df, sales_df):

12️⃣ Cash Runway Estimator
def cash_runway(current_cash, burn_rate):

13️⃣ ROI of Promotions
def promo_roi(promos_df, unit_df):

✅ THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE

You do NOT need all of this now.

Your perfect next 5 functions are:

✅ If I were your CTO, I’d add only these first:

true_profit_by_channel

true_profit_by_region

units_sold_by_month

forecast_next_month_units

days_of_inventory_left

These five turn your agent into:

🧠 “What should I scale?”
🧮 “What will break next?”
💰 “What actually makes money?”

Which is exactly founder-grade intelligence.
